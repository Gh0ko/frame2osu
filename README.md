# About

This is a converter for videos and gifs to a set of pngs compatible with osu skinning animation format 
e.g. somevideo.mp4 --> filename-0.png, filename-1.png, filename-2.png...

This is just a project i did for practice (im not a good programmer) so theres a lot that can be improved.
Feel free to message me on discord if anything: imghoko

~~FFmpeg carried my ass on this project so hard~~

## Filename and Stage side
The filename is the prefix for the images for example if filename is "cursor" the output will be cursor-0.png, cursor-1.png, cursor-2.png... and so on

Stage side is specifically for mania_stage_bottom because is the only animatable element on gameplay, it makes a transparent padding on the images to offset them to one side  
## To-Do:
- ~~Add stage option to make animation on the side of the stage~~ Done
- Rework UI
