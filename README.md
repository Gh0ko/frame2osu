# About

This is a converter for videos and gifs to a set of pngs compatible with osu skinning animation format 
e.g. somevideo.mp4 --> filename-0.png, filename-1.png, filename-2.png...

This is just a project i did for practice (im not a good programmer) so theres a lot that can be improved.
Feel free to message me on discord if anything: imghoko

## To-Do:
- ~~Add stage option to make animation on the side of the stage~~ Done
- Better UI
